# UI-grid-control-scroll-view-with-button
In Unity can I make some sort of data grid control? YES! I can. In this tutorial I make a grid like UI control and populate the grid with mp3 files found on my harddrive. I also play the mp3 songs found on my harddrive in unity using the NAudio.dll from the internet and WWW class from Unity.
